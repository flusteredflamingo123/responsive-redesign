        <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
        <div class = "content">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p> <span class = "bold"> The task: </span>  This project consisted of three parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify usability problems with an existing webpage.</li>
                    <li>Create low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes of a new design 
                        that addresses those problems and is responsive to different screen sizes.</li>
                    <li>Finally, develop the redesigned webpage.</li>
                </ol>
            <div><p><span class = "bold">The flawed webpage: </span>  <a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/interactive-sky-chart/" target="_blank"> A night sky tracker</a> 
                made by skyandtelescope.org. Users can view how different parts of the night sky look at various times and locations.</p></div>
            
            <div class = "image-and-caption">
                    <img id="webpage" src="images/webpage.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Sky and Telescope's interactive sky chart webpage.">
                    <p class = "caption">Sky & Telescope's interactive sky chart webpage. </p>
            </div>

            <p>I chose this page because although the service it offers works excellently, the interface has some problems, which I discovered one night when I tried to use 
                the page on my phone to determine what constellations I was seeing.</p>
                <div class = "center">
                    <div class = "two-panes">
                        <div class = "image-and-caption">
                        <img class = "mobile" src="images/mobile1.jpg" alt="A mobile view of the webpage showing many buttons.">
                        <p class = "caption">There are a lot of buttons... which ones do I actually <br> need in order to identify constellations?</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class = "image-and-caption">
                            <img class = "mobile" src="images/mobile2.jpg" alt="A mobile view of the webpage showing a difficult to read star chart.">
                            <p class = "caption"> How am I meant to read anything on this star chart?</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

            <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
            <p>The page's design flaws can be broken into issues relating to usability, learnability, and memorability:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Usability</th>
                    <th>Learnability</th>
                    <th>Memorability</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In order to update the date or time, a submit button must be pressed, which is less efficient than automatically 
                                updating the page when the date or time is changed.</li>
                            <li>
                                On mobile, the star chart shrinks such that pieces of text overlap one another, making it difficult to read
                                the chart's information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On mobile, you cannot press the change time buttons while also viewing how the sky image moves as a result, so 
                                the user is required to scroll back and forth to see the effect of their actions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The controls for setting the date and location are the only settings needed to begin using the page, 
                                so these options should be separated in the top left. Currently, it is difficult for new users to determine what they need to interact with.</li>
                            <li>
                                The area of the sky that is displayed can be moved by dragging the window on the sky chart, a feature that is not at
                                signaled to the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There is no clear hierarchy, as headers have barely more weight than other text, and the interactable components
                                are mostly not aligned with one another.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The "Display Options" are not organized, making it difficult for a returning user to remember where certain
                                settings are located.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Returning users who recall changing what part of the sky is displayed by clicking and dragging might
                                drag the sky image itself, which does not work. This feature could be included to eliminate the need for users
                                to remember exactly where this control is located.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>I also analyzed the page's accessibility via WebAIM WAVE, which revealed
            that the dropdown menus and checkboxes are missing labels to explain their functions. This means that users who employ a
            screen reader might have difficulty knowing what each option does. Additionally, &lttable&gt HTML elements are used to position
            components of the page, which could also confuse screen readers expecting tabular data to read.</p>
            <h2>Redesign</h2>
            <p>
                I first created low-fidelity wireframes showcasing how the page's design could be improved for desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.
            </p>
            <div class = "image-and-caption">
              <img id = "wireframe1" src="images/wireframe1.PNG" alt="A wireframe for the redesigned desktop page.">
              <p class = "caption">Desktop wireframe.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "center">
                <div class = "two-panes">
                    <div class = "image-and-caption">
                        <img class = "wireframe2" src="images/wireframe2.PNG" alt="A wireframe for the redesigned tablet page.">
                        <p class = "caption">Tablet wireframe.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "image-and-caption">
                        <img class = "wireframe2" src="images/wireframe3.PNG" alt="A wireframe for the redesigned mobile page.">
                        <p class = "caption"> Mobile wireframe.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Then, I converted the wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes. To ensure that the style of the page remained consistent,
                I created the following style guide:
            </p>
            <div class = "image-and-caption">
                <img id = "guide" src="images/guide.PNG" alt="A style guide showcasing resusable components of the page.">
                <p class = "caption">A style guide showcasing the resuable elements of the redesigned page.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Like with the wireframes, I created a high-fidelity prototype of the page for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 
                They are annotated with explanations of how a developer can implement the design and ensure the page is responsive to different screen sizes.
            </p>

            <div class = "image-and-caption">
                <img id = "hifi1" src="images/hifi1.PNG" alt="A high-fidelity prototype for the redesigned desktop page.">
                <p class = "caption">Desktop prototype.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "center">
                <div class = "two-panes">
                    <div class = "image-and-caption">
                        <img class = "hifi2" src="images/hifi2.PNG" alt="A high-fidelity prototype for the redesigned tablet page.">
                        <p class = "caption">Tablet prototype.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "image-and-caption">
                        <img class = "hifi2" src="images/hifi3.PNG" alt="A high-fidelity prototype for the redesigned mobile page.">
                        <p class = "caption"> Mobile prototype.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>




            <h2>The Result</h2>
            <p> Finally, I developed the redesigned page, <a href="https://flusteredflamingo123.github.io/redesigned-page/" target="_blank">accessible here</a></p>
            <div class = "image-and-caption">
                <img id="final" src="images/final.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the redesigned page.">
                <p class = "caption"> The final redesigned page.</p>
            </div>
